# Grade_Calculation_Project
Easily calculate the validity of your students from the course by writing the grade percentages according to you

Hello teachers! As an educator, I understand how much time we spend on writing and calculating our students' grades.
I have something that will make our lives easier! Using the code I've prepared, we can easily list and view the course grades of our students, one by one, with just a single click, by using the file that contains the students' grades (which we prepared previously) and organize them in a new folder.
You can customize the percentages of the grades according to your own grading scale. Let's save time, make life easier !
